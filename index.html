      <p><b>Step 1:</b> The silicon dioxide of either quartzite gravel or crushed quartz
        is placed into an electric arc furnace. A carbon arc is then applied to
        release the oxygen. The products are carbon dioxide and molten silicon.
        This simple process yields silicon with one percent impurity, useful in
        many industries but not the solar cell industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step 2:</b> The 99 percent pure silicon is purified even further using the
        floating zone technique. A rod of impure silicon is passed through a
        heated zone several times in the same direction. This procedure "drags"
        the impurities toward one end with each pass. At a specific point, the
        silicon is deemed pure, and the impure end is removed.

        <b>Step 3:</b> Solar cells are made from silicon boules, polycrystalline
        structures that have the atomic structure of a single crystal. The most
        commonly used process for creating the boule is called the Czochralski
        method. In this process, a seed crystal of silicon is dipped into melted
        polycrystalline silicon. As the seed crystal is withdrawn and rotated, a
        cylindrical ingot or "boule" of silicon is formed. The ingot withdrawn
        is unusually pure, because impurities tend to remain in the liquid.

    <div>
      <p><b>Step 4:</b>From the boule, silicon wafers are sliced one at a time using a
        circular saw whose inner diameter cuts into the rod, or many at once
        with a multiwire saw. (A diamond saw produces cuts that are as wide as
        the wafer—. 5 millimeter thick.) Only about one-half of the silicon is
        lost from the boule to the finished circular wafer—more if the wafer is
        then cut to be rectangular or hexagonal. Rectangular or hexagonal wafers
        are sometimes used in solar cells because they can be fitted together
        perfectly, thereby utilizing all available space on the front surface of
        the solar cell.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Step 5:</b>The wafers are then polished to remove saw marks. (It has recently been
        found that rougher cells absorb light more effectively, therefore some
        manufacturers have chosen not to polish the wafer.)

        <b>Step 6:</b> The traditional way of doping (adding impurities to) silicon
        wafers with boron and phosphorous is to introduce a small amount of
        boron during the Czochralski process in step #3 above. The wafers are
        then sealed back to back and placed in a furnace to be heated to
        slightly below the melting point of silicon (2,570 degrees Fahrenheit or
        1,410 degrees Celsius) in the presence of phosphorous gas. The
        phosphorous atoms "burrow" into the silicon, which is more porous
        because it is close to becoming a liquid. The temperature and time given
        to the process is carefully controlled to ensure a uniform junction of
        proper depth. A more recent way of doping silicon with phosphorous is to
        use a small particle accelerator to shoot phosphorous ions into the
        ingot. By controlling the speed of the ions, it is possible to control
        their penetrating depth. This new process, however, has generally not
        been accepted by commercial manufacturers.

        <b>Step 7:</b> Electrical contacts connect each solar cell to another and to
        the receiver of produced current. The contacts must be very thin (at
        least in the front) so as not to block sunlight to the cell. Metals such
        as palladium/silver, nickel, or copper are vacuum-evaporated This
        illustration shows the makeup of a typical solar cell. The cells are
        encapsulated in ethylene vinyl acetate and placed in a metal frame that
        has a mylar backsheet and glass cover. This illustration shows the
        makeup of a typical solar cell. The cells are encapsulated in ethylene
        vinyl acetate and placed in a metal frame that has a mylar backsheet and
        glass cover. through a photoresist, silkscreened, or merely deposited on
        the exposed portion of cells that have been partially covered with wax.
        All three methods involve a system in which the part of the cell on
        which a contact is not desired is protected, while the rest of the cell
        is exposed to the metal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step 8:</b> After the contacts are in place, thin strips ("fingers") are
        placed between cells. The most commonly used strips are tin-coated
        copper

        <b>Step 9:</b> Because pure silicon is shiny, it can reflect up to 35 percent
        of the sunlight. To reduce the amount of sunlight lost, an
        anti-reflective coating is put on the silicon wafer. The most commonly
        used coatings are titanium dioxide and silicon oxide, though others are
        used. The material used for coating is either heated until its molecules
        boil off and travel to the silicon and condense, or the material
        undergoes sputtering. In this process, a high voltage knocks molecules
        off the material and deposits them onto the silicon at the opposite
        electrode. Yet another method is to allow the silicon itself to react
        with oxygen- or nitrogen-containing gases to form silicon dioxide or
        silicon nitride. Commercial solar cell manufacturers use silicon
        nitride.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step 10:</b> he finished solar cells are then encapsulated; that is, sealed
        into silicon rubber or ethylene vinyl acetate. The encapsulated solar
        cells are then placed into an aluminum frame that has a mylar or tedlar
        backsheet and a glass or plastic cover.

      Studies show that production takes more resources than accounted for. Pollution, transport, installation and
      recycling are often not very documented. Also it differs on the location of production and deployment. Waste of
      production includes toxic elements, pollution of clean water, mining operations. Depending on the case solar
      panels can be beneficial (*1)
      </p>

        Solar energy is largely subsidized. Because of this it gets beneficial to consumers. The drawback is that the
        price is not a measurement of real cost of production (and possibly use of resources). (*2)
